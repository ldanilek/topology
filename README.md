# Topology

This web page simulates basic physics -- acceleration and angular acceleration on the surface of a [Fundamental polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_polygon).

Select an object like a Klein Bottle and then drive the little rocket around. Note at the edges your orientation can rotate or flip.

While not particularly interesting as a game yet, the code has some cool examples of multiplying affine transformations and seeing what happens. For example, the way we simulate acceleration through conjugation is mind-bending to me.

## Extensions

- Implement collisions between objects
- Implement more kinds of edges, like a diagonal mirror or hexagonal polygons
- Allow some edges to cause scaling or skewing effects
- Game mechanics like goals, shooting lasers from the rocket, etc.
- Draw trails and make designs -- maybe with a challenge to find generators of [fundamental groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group).
- Follow the rocket from its perspective and see how objects shift/reflect around it
