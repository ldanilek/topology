# Topology

This web page simulates basic physics -- acceleration and angular acceleration on the surface of a [Fundamental polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_polygon).

Select an object like a Klein Bottle and then drive the little rocket around. Note at the edges your orientation can rotate or flip.

While not particularly interesting as a game, the code has some cool examples of multiplying affine transformations and seeing what happens.

## Extensions

- Implement collisions between objects
- Implement more kinds of edges, like a diagonal mirror
- Allow some edges to cause scaling or skewing effects
